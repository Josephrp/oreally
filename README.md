## Install and Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Poetry installed. If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Or using `pipx`:

```bash
pipx install poetry
```

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Josephrp/oreally.git
   cd oreally
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for your project. Activate this environment using:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

### Running `main.py`

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can run `main.py` using the Python interpreter managed by Poetry:

```bash
poetry run python main.py
```
